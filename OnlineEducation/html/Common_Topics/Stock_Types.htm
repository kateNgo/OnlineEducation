<h1>Stock Types</h1>

<p style="margin-left:6.00pt;"><font style="font-size:10pt; font-weight:bold;">1.&#160;</font><font style="font-size:12pt; color:teal; font-weight:bold;">Stock</font><font style="font-size:12pt;">: this is a normal stock item and will be treated as such by AM-WIN. This means that it is purchased as an asset into the stock file and full stock control features are available for this item.</font></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0">&#160;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li style="font-size:10pt;">
<p style="margin-left:6.00pt;"><font style="font-size:10pt; font-weight:bold;">2.&#160;</font><font style="font-size:12pt; color:teal; font-weight:bold;">Non Stock class</font><font style="font-size:12pt;">: a non stock item still allows you to have stock control. However it doesnform part of your stock asset and is treated like any Buy in &amp; sell out revenue item such as 6030 &amp; 7030 revenue accounts. The only difference between revenue and non stock items is that being a non stock item means you can track the purchase &amp; sales details by the part number and not just a revenue account number. This allows better tracking of non stocked items. You should set up your revenue accounts for non-stock items between 6030  6999 and expense accounts between 7030  7999. Non stock items include stock that you may buy and sell on a casual or even regular basis that you donactually keep in stock.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:6.00pt;"><font style="font-size:10pt; font-weight:bold;">3.&#160;</font><font style="font-size:12pt; color:teal; font-weight:bold;">Consignment stock class</font><font style="font-size:12pt;">: Consignment stock allows you to track stock which is on consignment from a supplier, such as batteries and tyres. When purchasing consignment stock it is treated just like a non stock item with the only difference being that a consignment stock report can be generated to advise what stock has been sold and needs to be replaced by the supplier. You should set up different revenue and expense accounts for non stock items compared to consignment stock items. You should set up your revenue accounts for Consignment stock items between 6030  6999 and expense accounts between 7030  7999.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:6.00pt;"><font style="font-size:10pt; font-weight:bold;">4.&#160;</font><font style="font-size:12pt; color:teal; font-weight:bold;">Revenue class</font><font style="font-size:12pt;">: Revenue stock is also very similar to non-stocked items however the stock on hand is not controlled. This is simply an income item for non-stocked items which are charged out but never actually purchased in as a non-stock item. Although we do not recommend it, labour would be a revenue item as you do not buy labour but you do sell it. Selling a wheel balance or alignment that you do in your workshop would also be classed as a revenue item rather than a non-stock item. You should set up your revenue accounts for Revenue items between 6030  6999 or 4000  4999 or 8000  8999. However, there are no set limitations for these accounts. BE CAREFUL! There are also no expense accounts for these items.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:6.00pt;"><font style="font-size:10pt; font-weight:bold;">5.&#160;</font><font style="font-size:12pt; color:teal; font-weight:bold;">Trade in Stock:</font> <font style="font-size:12pt;">Trade in stock allows for the correct calculation of GST and the correct processing of stock which is treated as a trade-in under the GST second hand goods legislation. This means that you can only claim a input credit for the price paid for a trade in Item from a private customer at the time that item is sold at a later date. However, if you trade in an item from a business which is registered for GST then you can claim the input credit immediately from the tax office by obtaining a TAX INVOICE for the trade-in from the business customer. This means that you will ONLY set a stock item to trade-in if that particular item is traded from a private customer who is not registered for GST or does not have an ABN number. Otherwise it should be treated as a normal stock item.</font></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-indent:36.00pt;"><font style="font-size:12pt;">Example:&#160;Trading in a vehicle:</font></p>
<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><font style="font-size:12pt;">Lets say that you sell a car for $22,000 including GST and that car has a part number of ABC123 (usually the rego or stock number of that vehicle).</font></p>
<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><font style="font-size:12pt;">We are then trading in a car XYZ123 for a value of $5500 with no GST as the customer is a private person and not registered for GST and has no ABN number.</font></p>
<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><font style="font-size:12pt;">Firstly we invoice the customer $22000 inc GST for the ABC123 vehicle with a GST content of $2000. We then add a new stock item for the value of $5000 ex GST and $5500 including GST. Even though GST does not apply to this vehicle at this stage still enter it this way and the system will handle it correctly as long as you set the stock class of this item to Trade-In.</font></p>
<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><font style="font-size:12pt;">When the item has been added put it on the invoice as a quantity of 1 (thatminus (-) 1) It will not work correctly if you enter the quantity as a plus.</font></p>
<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><font style="font-size:12pt;">You will note that even though the invoice now totals $16500 the GST is still set to $2000 as the GST is charged on the full sales price and not on the price less the trade-in. This will place a sale price of $22000 in GST for your BAS with a GST component of $2000 and also place a negative NO GST sale price of -$5500 with no GST. The traded item will be updated in the stock file as being a purchase rather than a negative sale.</font></p>
<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left:36.00pt;"><font style="font-size:12pt;">At a later stage you may then sell the traded XYZ123 item. In order to do this you simply invoice the trade in item as a part number XYZ123 as you would sell any other item and you may also trade in a vehicle as described above on that invoice. When selling the XYZ123 item you must sell that item as a positive (+) quantiy of 1. The system will automatically recognise this as a traded item and charge GST on that item.</font></p>
<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0">&#160;</p>
<h6 class="Heading7"><font style="font-size:12pt;">Lets say you sell the Traded Item XYZ123 for $8800 including GST. The invoice will have a total of $8800 (less any further trade-in) with a GST component of $800. The system because it recognises the sale as a trade-in item will also create a GST input entry in the GST purchases file of $5500 with a GST input credit amount of $500 which of course is 1/11</font><font style="font-size:12pt; font-weight:normal; vertical-align:super;">th</font> <font style="font-size:12pt;">of the traded price.</font></h6>
