<h6 class="Heading7">Credit Returns</h6>
<p style="margin-left: 108.00pt;">&#160;</p>
<h1 style="text-align: center; font-size: 20pt; color: #0000ff; text-decoration: underline; ">CREDIT 
 RETURNS</h1>
<p style="margin-top: 5.00pt; margin-bottom: 5.00pt; text-align: justify; 
	 font-size: 16pt;">By default, credit returns automatically get allocated 
 to the customeraccount. However, you may require to give the customer 
 a refund by cash, cheque, credit card or some other method in the event 
 that they have already paid for the invoice and require a refund.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 5.00pt; margin-bottom: 5.00pt; text-align: justify; 
	 font-size: 16pt;">In order to do this, you will need to change the 
 credit method to something other than account.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 5.00pt; margin-bottom: 5.00pt; text-align: justify; 
	 font-weight: bold; font-size: 16pt;">If The Credit Method Is Not Account 
 Do The Following:</p>
<p style="margin-top: 5.00pt; margin-bottom: 5.00pt; text-align: justify; 
	 font-size: 16pt;">This option is used when the Amount you wish to 
 credit is to be refunded to the customer in the form of <font style="font-weight: bold;">CASH, 
 CHEQUE, EFT, CREDIT CARD etc</font>. This will reduce the cash, bank or 
 credit card ledger by the refund amount and return any parts on the credit 
 back into stock.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 5.00pt; margin-bottom: 5.00pt; text-align: justify; 
	 font-size: 16pt;">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 5.00pt; margin-bottom: 5.00pt; text-align: justify; 
	 font-size: 16pt;">For example, a customer purchases some parts and 
 pays for them. However they come back later and tells you that they didn't 
 need the parts and you decide to credit the original invoice and give 
 them their money back.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 5.00pt; margin-bottom: 5.00pt; text-align: justify; 
	 font-size: 16pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;" 
							 color="#FF0000">Note:</font> <font style="font-style: italic;" 
	 color="#FF0000">If the customer has a zero balance and you use the 
 Account method</font><font style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;" 
							 color="#FF0000">,</font> <font style="font-style: italic;" 
															 color="#FF0000">then 
 the amount you refund will be treated as an account credit and you will 
 finish up with an unallocated credit amount on that particular account.</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 5.00pt; margin-bottom: 5.00pt; text-align: justify; 
	 font-size: 16pt;">After selecting your customer and your invoice or 
 parts or revenue details, Left click on the <font style="font-weight: bold;">Process 
 button</font> and the transaction is now complete. You can print out a 
 receipt if you wish.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 16pt;">When the credit return 
 is processed, if you selected a cheque as the refund method you will be 
 required to enter the cheque details later to be made available when you 
 are doing your bank reconciliation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 16pt;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 16pt;">You will also be asked 
 if the cheque has been banked so that the system knows whether to take 
 the money from the bank account or the undeposited cheque account.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 5.00pt; margin-bottom: 5.00pt; text-align: justify; 
	 font-size: 16pt;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; color: #ff0000; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; 
	 font-size: 16pt;">Please note that the question is asking whether 
 you have banked the money through the software and not whether you have 
 physically banked it or not.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 16pt;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-weight: bold; font-size: 16pt;">Select 
 Invoice to return item</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 16pt;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 16pt;">When a credit return is 
 done for a customer and the part is manually selected, you are given the 
 opportunity to select which invoice to credit that part from. This allows 
 you to reconcile the return of parts against the original invoice and 
 ensure that a customer doesnreturn parts to you that were purchased from 
 another supplier.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 16pt;">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.00pt; text-indent: -36.00pt; text-align: justify; 
	 font-weight: bold; font-size: 16pt;">Credit Type (POS or JOB)</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; font-size: 16pt;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 16pt;">If you have a specific 
 requirement to separate your job and point of sale invoices, then you 
 will also want to separate credit returns that will effect the total sales 
 within these two areas. When doing a credit return, if you select the 
 invoice to credit, the system will automatically recognise what type of 
 invoice it was and credit it appropriately. However, if you do not select 
 the invoice to be credited, you can manually change the credit type to 
 choose either a job or POS credit. By default, the system nominates JOB 
 as the credit type.</p>
