<h1>Goods In Screen</h1>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><font style="font-size:20pt; color:blue; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline;">Goods In Screen</font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font style="font-size:12pt;">Goods In is a process that allows you to receive multiple for the same supplier invoice across multiple purchase orders.</font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font style="font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold; font-style:italic;">Details:</font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font style="font-size:12pt;">The Goods In module allows you to receive goods in from a purchase order. The Goods in Screen is separate to the Purchase order screen and provides the ability to receive multiple goods in from a single purchase order without needing to process an invoice against the purchase order.</font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font style="font-size:12pt;">It will also allow you to process a single delivery docket or invoice which covers multiple purchase orders if the supplier has issued a delivery docket or invoice which contains goods from more than one purchase order. It will then also allow you to process an invoice from a supplier where the invoice covers more than one delivery docket.</font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font style="font-size:12pt;">When you open the Goods in screen you can either create a new Goods in document, or revise an existing Goods in document. To create a new goods in document you simply click on the New Button and select the supplier. You can then import all or part of an existing order or select a part number from an order by selecting either the import orders or import parts button.</font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><img src="../../image/ebx_-212039659.gif" border="0" alt="image\ebx_-212039659.gif" style="width:100%; max-width:128px" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font style="font-size:12pt;">If you click the import orders button, a screen will appear with a list of all outstanding orders for the selected supplier. The bottom of the same screen shows the list of parts that are on the selected order. As you click on the order at the top of the screen, the bottom shows the items on that order.</font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font style="font-size:12pt;">You can then either click on the tag all button to mark all items on the order as received or the untag all to mark them all as not received. If most of the items are received then it is quicker to tag all items and then individually untag the items that were not received.</font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font style="font-size:12pt;">To receive a part qty of an order, highlight the item and then press the TAB key. You can then type the qty received and either press the TAB or ENTER key to update the item. Any items not received go on back order automatically unless you change or remove the backorder qty.</font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font style="font-size:12pt;">If you wish to receive items from another order onto the same goods in record then simply select another order and tag the required items on that order. For multi location users, make sure the correct stock location is chosen for receiving the order. Once all items required have been selected, click the OK button and the selected items will be imported onto the screen.</font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font style="font-size:12pt;">The goods in screen indicated the order number the item was taken from as well as the other item details. Thereno "save only" button on the goods in screen as it is too dangerous to have the screen save and not process as another use could receive the same item as you on another computer if we allowed this.</font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font style="font-size:12pt;">You can either "save and receive" or "save and final" the items. Save and receive receives the item into stock and update the stock control areas of the system. You can also "save and final" which will also update the creditors.</font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font style="font-size:12pt;">The cost of the item can be updated by double clicking on the item and changing the cost. After the cost is change you can then print a report which indicates the items which have had a cost change and what margin they reflect. This then allows someone to make a decision about changing the selling price of the items based on the cost change if the automatic selling price window is turned off.</font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><img src="../../image/ebx_-1858973877.gif" border="0" alt="image\ebx_-1858973877.gif" style="width:100%; max-width:128px" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font style="font-size:12pt;">You can also receive items into the goods in screen by using the import parts button. This allows you to tag items by the part number if you were not sure of the order number the part was ordered on originally. You can tag one or more items in the same way as you do to import orders and then place the items on the goods in screen.</font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font style="font-size:12pt;">Items can also be manually added to the goods in screen using the parts button or revenue items such as freight / delivery fee can be added which would not have been on the original order. You may have also added items to the order by phone and not updated onto the original purchase order which makes this a handy feature.</font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font style="font-size:12pt;">Even though you cannot save a goods in without receiving it, you can part receive a goods in, go to lunch or go home and then come back to the goods in screen to receive the rest of the delivery. To do this, simply select the goods in record from the list and either double click on the item or click on the revise button to revise the selected record. You can then add more items to the goods in record and receive the additional items. Only the additional items added are received as the previously added items would have been received when the records were last saved.</font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><img src="../../image/ebx_-1770275009.gif" border="0" alt="image\ebx_-1770275009.gif" style="width:100%; max-width:38px" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font style="font-size:12pt;">If you have enabled barcode printing within the software, once goods in is received, the system will enable a print barcode label button. This button will then enable you to print barcodes for all of the items received through the goods in screen.</font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font style="font-size:12pt;">This is done on a button and not an automatic process because the person physically entering the delivery docket may not be in the same location or the same person who is responsible for printing and labeling the stock items that were received. An admin person may process the delivery docket and at a later stage, or in a different location the spare parts people may then print the labels for the parts received.</font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><img src="../../image/ebx_-1288094539.gif" border="0" alt="image\ebx_-1288094539.gif" style="width:100%; max-width:98px" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font style="font-size:12pt;">When the goods in record, is ready to be finalised, you can then ensure that the price of the item and the total price of the invoice is accurate. You are then required to enter the supplier invoice number into the reference number field and then click the save/final button. The save/final button will then update the creditor records as well as update any stock records that have not previously been received.</font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font style="font-size:12pt;">At this stage you are prompted to print the goods in report. This report contains details of the items received, the bin locations and any stock allocations required to jobs and customer orders.</font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font style="font-size:12pt;">Once the goods in has been finalised the records are removed from the Goods in screen. When the Goods from the Goods in are received or finalised the purchase order they were received from is automatically updated and any items not fully received go onto backorder against that purchase order.</font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font style="font-size:12pt;">These items can then be received through another goods in process. The purchase order is given a status of goods in as soon as any goods in process is received for any item on that purchase order. Once a purchase order is flagged as a goods in order, you are</font> <font style="font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline;">only</font> <font style="font-size:12pt;">able to receive further items from that purchase order via the goods in screen. You can still receive and finalise purchase orders through the original purchase order screen as long as a goods in has not been processed against that order. All records remain on the original purchase order until that purchase order is fully received or deleted from the system. If a goods in process completes the receipt of an order then that order is automatically deleted.</font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><img src="../../image/ebx_-1325513864.gif" border="0" alt="image\ebx_-1325513864.gif" style="width:100%; max-width:89px" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font style="font-size:12pt;">You may be required to enter a single supplier invoice which covers more than one delivery docket. This can be done by selecting one of the goods in items and then merging the selected item into another goods in for the same supplier. You do this by clicking on the merge to button and then selecting the delivery docket to merge with the current one that is open. This will then create a single delivery docket with the items on both selected documents joined together.</font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font style="font-size:12pt;">You could then repeat the same processes to merge further delivery dockets together. You are then able to enter the supplier invoice number into the reference field and finalise the goods in delivery docket using the save/final button. Once a goods in is finalised, you are then able to view the finalised details from the supplier history screen.</font></p>
